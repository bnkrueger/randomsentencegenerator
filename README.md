# randomsentencegenerator
Generates a random sentence using API by printing it to a text file

This Python program generates a random English sentence using an API.

This program REQUIRES the Python package requests. Please make sure this package is installed before trying to use the program. 

The program will generate a random sentence to a text file. To use the random sentence you can read this file. How you read this file will be different depending on the language you are using. 
Currently, there is a function in the program called read_from_file. If you are not using Python you can delete this function as you will be reading the text file via your other language.
